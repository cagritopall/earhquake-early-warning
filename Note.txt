This Arduino code orchestrates an earthquake detection and safety system, employing
ADXL335 and ADXL345 accelerometers, a relay, servo motor, buzzer, and voice recognition
module. It initializes and calibrates the sensors, establishes hardware configurations, and
sets up voice commands. In the main loop, it continuously monitors accelerometer data,
65
triggers alerts and gas shutoff during seismic events, and responds to voice commands for
activating or deactivating the buzzer. This code amalgamates sensor data, safety
mechanisms, and user interaction to create a comprehensive earthquake detection system.
